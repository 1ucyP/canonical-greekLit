<l n="15"> It can only be for this cause: for indeed I think my own sister Electra is approaching, distinguished by her bitter grief.    Oh grant me, Zeus, to avenge my father's death, and may you be my willing ally!

He said that, enraged by the loss of my possessions,<note anchored="true" n="273" resp="Smyth">Tucker interprets this passage to mean “fiercely stern with penalties not to be paid with money,” that is, penalties demanding the death of the guilty, who may not offer money to satisfy the claims of vengeance; and thus an allusion to “wer-gild,” known in Homeric times.</note> I should kill them in requital just as they killed.  And he declared that otherwise</l>
<l n="275">I should pay the debt myself with my own life, after many grievous sufferings.  For he spoke revealing to mortals the wrath of malignant powers from underneath the earth, and telling of plagues:  leprous ulcers that mount with fierce fangs on the flesh</l>
<l n="280">and eat away its primal nature; and how a white down<note anchored="true" n="282" resp="Smyth">The down upon the sore, not the temples turned white (cp.

For the dark bolt of the infernal powers, who are stirred by kindred victims calling for vengeance, and madness, and groundless terrors out of the night, torment and harass a man, and he sees clearly, though he moves his eyebrows in the dark.<note anchored="true" n="291" resp="Smyth">He cannot sleep through terror of the Erinyes of his murdered kin whom he has not avenged.</note>
                  </l>
<l n="285">And with his body marred by the brazen scourge, he is even chased in exile from his country.</l>
<l n="290">And the god declared that to such as these it is not allowed to have a part either in the ceremonial cup or in the cordial libation; his father's wrath, though unseen, bars him from the altar; no one receives him or lodges with him; and at last, despised by all, friendless, he perishes,</l>
<l n="295">shrivelled pitifully by a death that wastes him utterly away.
               Must I not put my trust in oracles such as these? Yet even if I do not trust them, the deed must still be done.  For many impulses conspire to one conclusion.  Besides the god's command, my keen grief for my father,</l>

               It is a simple story.  My sister must go inside, and I charge her to keep concealed this pact with me,</l>
<l n="555">so that as by craft they killed a worthy man, so by craft they may likewise be caught and perish in the very same snare, even as Loxias decreed, lord Apollo, the prophet who has never before been false.
               In the guise of a stranger, one fully equipped,</l>
<l n="560">I will come to the outer gate, and with me Pylades, whom you see here, as a guest and ally of the house.

And in case none of the keepers of the door will give us a hearty welcome</l>
<l n="565">on the plea that the house is afflicted with trouble by the gods, then we will wait so that anyone passing the house will consider and say: “Why then does Aegisthus have his door shut on his suppliant, if in fact he is at home and knows?”</l>
<l n="570">
               
               But if I indeed pass the outermost threshold of the gate and find that man sitting on my father's throne, or if then coming face to face with me he lifts and casts down his eyes, know well: before he can even say “Of what land is this stranger?” I will skewer him with my swift sword and lay him dead.</l>
<l n="575">The fury that has no fill of slaughter shall for her third and crowning drink drink unmixed blood!
               Now you, Electra, keep strict watch over what happens inside the house, so that our plans may fit together well.</l>

               Behold this pair, oppressors of the land, who murdered my father and ransacked my house!  They were majestic then, when they sat on their thrones,</l>
<l n="975">and are lovers even now, as one may judge by what has happened to them, and their oath holds true to their pledges.  Together they vowed a league of death against my unhappy father, and together they vowed to die, and they have kept their promise well.
               But now regard again, you who hear this account of ills,</l>
<l n="980">the device for binding my unhappy father, with which his hands were manacled, his feet fettered.  Spread it out!  Stand around in a circle, and display this covering for a man, that the Father may see—not mine, but he who surveys all this, the Sun—</l>
<l n="985">that he may see the impious work of my own mother, that he may be my witness in court that I justly pursued this death, my own mother's.  For I do not speak of Aegisthus' death: he has suffered the penalty prescribed for adulterers.</l>
<l n="990">
               
               But she who devised this abhorrent deed against her husband, whose children she bore, a burden under her belt, a burden once dear, but now a hateful ill, as it seems: what do you think of her?  Had she been born a seasnake or a viper, I think her very touch without her bite would have caused anyone else to rot,</l>

               But since I would have you know, for I do not know how it will end: I think I am a charioteer driving my team far beyond the course.  For my ungoverned wits are whirling me away overmastered, and at my heart fear wishes to sing and dance to a tune of wrath.</l>
<l n="1025">But while I am still in my senses, I proclaim to those who hold me dear and declare that not without justice did I slay my mother, the unclean murderess of my father, and a thing loathed by the gods.
               And for the spells that gave me the courage for this deed I count Loxias, the prophet of <placeName key="tgn,7010770">Pytho</placeName>,</l>
<l n="1030">my chief source.  It was he who declared that, if I did this thing, I would be acquitted of wrongdoing.  But if I refrained—I will not name the penalty; for no bowshot could reach such a height of anguish.
               And now observe me, how armed with this branch and wreath I go as a suppliant, an outcast for the shedding of kindred blood, to the temple set square on the womb of the earth,</l>
<l n="1035">the precinct of Loxias, and to the bright fire said to be imperishable.<note anchored="true" n="1037" resp="Smyth">In the Delphic shrine there was an undying fire.</note> To no other hearth did Loxias bid me turn.
