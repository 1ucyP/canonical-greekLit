               <speaker>The Priestess of Pythian Apollo</speaker><l>
               First, in this prayer of mine, I give the place of highest honor among the gods to the first prophet, Earth; and after her to Themis, for she was the second to take this oracular seat of her mother, as legend tells. And in the third allotment, with Themis' consent and not by force,</l>
<l n="5">another Titan, child of Earth, Phoebe, took her seat here. She gave it as a birthday gift to Phoebus, who has his name from Phoebe. Leaving the lake<note anchored="true" n="9" resp="Smyth">A circular lake in the island of Apollo's birth.</note>and ridge of <placeName key="perseus,Delos">Delos</placeName>, he landed on Pallas' ship-frequented shores,</l>
<l n="10">and came to this region and the dwelling places on <placeName key="tgn,7011022">Parnassus</placeName>. The children of Hephaistos,<note anchored="true" n="13" resp="Smyth">The Athenians, because Erichthonius, who was identified with Erechtheus, was the son of Hephaestus, who first fashioned axes.</note>road-builders taming the wildness of the untamed land, escorted him with mighty reverence. And at his arrival, the people</l>
<l n="15">and Delphus, helmsman and lord of this land, made a great celebration for him. Zeus inspired his heart with prophetic skill and established him as the fourth prophet on this throne; but Loxias is the spokesman of Zeus, his father.
               These are the gods I place in the beginning of my prayer.</l>
<l n="20">And Pallas who stands before the temple<note anchored="true" n="21" resp="Smyth">The shrine of Pallas “before the temple,” close to <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName> on the main road leading to the sanctuary of Apollo.</note> is honored in my words; and I worship the Nymphs where the Corycian<note anchored="true" n="22" resp="Smyth">The Corycian cave, sacred to the Nymphs and Pan, has been identified with a grotto on the great plateau above <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName>.</note>rock is hollow, the delight of birds and haunt of gods. Bromius has held the region —I do not forget him— ever since he, as a god, led the Bacchantes in war,</l>
<l n="25">and contrived for Pentheus death as of a hunted hare. I call on the streams of Pleistus and the strength of Poseidon, and highest Zeus, the Fulfiller; and then I take my seat as prophetess upon my throne. And may they allow me now to have the best fortune, far better than on my previous entrances.</l>
<l n="30">And if there are any from among the Hellenes here, let them enter, in turn, by lot, as is the custom. For I prophesy as the god leads.<stage>She enters the temple and after a brief interval returns terror-stricken</stage>

              <l> Horrors to tell, horrors for my eyes to see, have sent me back from the house of Loxias,</l>
<l n="35">so that I have no strength and I cannot walk upright. I am running on hands and knees, with no quickness in my limbs; for an old woman, overcome with fright, is nothing, or rather she is like a child.
               I was on my way to the inner shrine, decked with wreaths; I saw on the center-stone<note anchored="true" n="40" resp="Smyth"> 
                     <foreign xml:lang="grc">o)mfalo/s</foreign>“navel” was the name given by the Delphians to a white stone (in Aeschylus' time placed in the inmost sanctuary of Apollo), which they regarded as marking the exact center of the earth. Near the great altar of Apollo the French excavators of <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName> discovered a navel-stone. <foreign xml:lang="grc">o)mfalo/s</foreign>is sometimes used of <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName> itself.</note>a man defiled in the eyes of the gods,</l>
<l n="40">occupying the seat of suppliants. His hands were dripping blood; he held a sword just drawn and an olive-branch, from the top of the tree, decorously crowned with a large tuft of wool, a shining fleece; for as to this I can speak clearly.</l>
<l n="45">
               
               Before this man an extraordinary band of women slept, seated on thrones. No! Not women, but rather Gorgons I call them; and yet I cannot compare them to forms of Gorgons either. Once before I saw some creatures in a painting,<note anchored="true" n="50" resp="Smyth">The Harpies.</note>
                  </l>
<l n="50">carrying off the feast of Phineus; but these are wingless in appearance, black, altogether disgusting; they snore with repulsive breaths, they drip from their eyes hateful drops; their attire is not fit to bring either before the statues of the gods or into the homes of men.</l>
<l n="55">I have never seen the tribe that produced this company, nor the land that boasts of rearing this brood with impunity and does not grieve for its labor afterwards.
               Let what is to come now be the concern of the master of this house,</l>
<l n="60">powerful Loxias himself. He is a prophet of healing, a reader of portents, and for others a purifier of homes.<stage>Exit</stage>

            <stage>The interior of the temple is disclosed. Enter, from the inner sanctuary, Apollo, who takes his stand beside Orestes at the center-stone. Near the suppliant are the Furies asleep. Hermes in the background.</stage>

               <speaker>Apollo</speaker><l>
               No! I will not abandon you. Your guardian to the end, close by your side or far removed,</l>
<l n="65">I will not be gentle to your enemies. So now you see these mad women overcome; these loathsome maidens have fallen asleep, old women, ancient children, with whom no god or man or beast ever mingles.</l>
<l n="70">They were even born for evil, since they live in evil gloom and in Tartarus under the earth, creatures hateful to men and to the Olympian gods. Nevertheless, escape and do not be cowardly.</l>
<l n="75">For as you go always over the earth that wanderers tread, they will drive you on, even across the wide mainland, beyond the sea and the island cities. Do not grow weary too soon, brooding on this labor, but when you have come to Pallas' city, sit down and hold in your arms her ancient image.</l>
<l n="80">And there, with judges of your case and speeches of persuasive charm, we shall find means to release you completely from your labors. For I persuaded you to take your mother's life.

<l n="95">because of those I killed the dead never cease to reproach me, and I wander in disgrace. I tell you that I am most greatly accused by them. And yet, although I have suffered cruelly in this way from my nearest kin,</l>
<l n="100">no divine power is angry on my behalf, slaughtered as I have been by the hands of a matricide. See these gashes in my heart, and from where they came! For the sleeping mind has clear vision, but in the daytime the fate of mortals is unforeseeable.</l>
<l n="105">
               
               Truly, you have lapped up many of my offerings—wineless libations, a sober appeasement; and I have sacrificed banquets in the solemn night upon a hearth of fire at an hour unshared by any god. I see all this trampled under foot.</l>

               Lady Athena, first of all I will take away a great anxiety from your last words. I am not a suppliant in need of purification, nor did I sit at your image with pollution on my hands.</l>
<l n="445">I will give you strong proof of this. It is the law for one who is defiled by shedding blood to be barred from speech until he is sprinkled with the blood of a new-born victim by a man who can purify from murder.</l>
<l n="450">Long before at other houses I have been thus purified both by victims and by flowing streams.
               And so I declare that this concern is out of the way. As to my family, you will soon learn. I am an <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName>; my father—you rightly inquire about him</l>

He did not die nobly, after he came home; but my black-hearted mother killed him after she covered him in a crafty snare that still remains to witness his murder in the bath.</l>
<l n="460">And when I came back home, having been an exile in the time before, I killed the woman who gave birth to me, I will not deny it, as the penalty in return for the murder of my dearly-loved father. Together with me Loxias is responsible for this deed,</l>
<l n="465">because he threatened me with pains, a goad for my heart, if I should fail to do this deed to those who were responsible. You judge whether I acted justly or not; whatever happens to me at your hands, I will be content.

Or. 552</bibl>; Frag. 1064, the Pythagoreans cited by Stobaeus (Hense ii. 72). The passage in the play has been invoked as evidence that the Athenians of the fifth century B.C. were upholding, some the ancient mode of tracing descent from the mother (the argument of the Erinyes); others, the patrilinear theory advocated by Apollo.</note> The one who mounts is the parent, whereas she, as a stranger for a stranger,</l>
<l n="660">preserves the young plant, if the god does not harm it.  And I will show you proof of what I say: a father might exist without a mother. A witness is here at hand, the child of Olympian Zeus, who was not nursed in the darkness of a womb,</l>

               No, I will not grow tired of telling you about these good things, so you will never be able to say that you, an ancient goddess, were cast out, dishonored and banished, from this land by me, a younger goddess, and by the mortal guardians of my city. But if you give holy reverence to Persuasion,</l>
<l n="885">the sweetness and charm of my tongue, then you might remain. But if you are not willing to stay, then surely it would be unjust for you to inflict on this city any wrath or rage or harm to the people. For it is possible for you to have a share of the land justly, with full honors.</l>
