    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="sal"><p>The Church of God which sojourns in Rome to the<note resp="editor" type="marginal">Salutation.</note> Church of God which sojourns in Corinth, to those who are called and sanctified by the will of God through our Lord Jesus Christ. Grace and peace from God Almighty be multiplied to you through Jesus Christ.</p></div></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1">
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p rend="indent">Owing to the sudden and repeated misfortunes<note resp="editor" type="marginal">Reason for delay in writing</note> and calamities<note resp="editor" type="footnote">Or, with Knopf’s text <q type="translation">critical circumstances.</q></note> which have befallen us, we consider that our attention has been somewhat delayed in turning to the questions disputed among you, beloved, and especially the abominable and unholy sedition, alien and foreign to the elect of God, which a few rash and self-willed persons have made blaze up to such a frenzy that your name, venerable and famous, and worthy as it is of all men’s love, has been much slandered.</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>For who has stayed with you without making<note resp="editor" type="marginal">The ancient fame of Corinth</note> proof of the virtue and stedfastness of your faith? Who has not admired the sobriety and Christian gentleness of your piety? Who has not reported your character so magnificent in its hospitality? And who has not blessed your perfect and secure <pb xml:id="p.11"/> knowledge?</p></div> 
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>For you did all things without respect of persons, and walked in the laws of God, obedient to your rulers, and paying all fitting honour to the older among you. On the young, too, you enjoined temperate and seemly thoughts, and to the women you gave instruction that they should do all things with a blameless and seemly and pure conscience, yielding a dutiful affection to their husbands. And you taught them to remain in the rule of obedience and to manage their households with seemliness, in all circumspection.</p></div></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="2">
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p rend="indent">And you were all humble-minded and in no wise arrogant, yielding subjection rather than demanding it, “giving more gladly than receiving,” satisfied with the provision of Christ, and paying attention to his words you stored them up carefully in your hearts, and kept his sufferings before your eyes.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>Thus a profound and rich peace was given to all, you had an insatiable desire to do good, and the Holy Spirit was poured out in abundance on you all.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>You were full of holy plans, and with pious confidence you stretched out your hands to Almighty God in a passion of goodness, beseeching him to be merciful towards any unwilling sin.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>Day and night you strove on behalf of the whole brotherhood <pb xml:id="p.13"/> that the number of his elect should be saved with mercy and compassion.<note resp="editor" type="footnote">The MS. reading means “conscience,” which gives no sense. There is also a variant in the previous word: the inferior MS. (C) reads “fear” instead of “mercy.”</note></p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>You were sincere and innocent, and bore no malice to one another.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>All sedition and all schism was abominable to you. You mourned over the transgressions of your neighbours; you judged their shortcomings as your own.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p>You were without regret in every act of kindness, “ready unto every good work.”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p>You were adorned by your virtuous and honourable citizenship and did all things in the fear of God.<note resp="editor" type="footnote">“God” is found only in L; the other authorities have “his fear,” but the meaning is plain.</note> The commandments and ordinances of the Lord were “written on the tables of your heart.”</p></div></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="3">
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p rend="indent">All glory and enlargement was given to you,<note resp="editor" type="marginal">The troubles at Corinth</note> and that which was written was fulfilled, “My Beloved ate and drank, and he was enlarged and waxed fat and kicked.”</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>From this arose jealousy and envy, strife and sedition, persecution and disorder, war and captivity.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>Thus “the worthless” rose up “against those who were in honour,” those of no reputation against the renowned, the foolish against the prudent, the “young against the old.”</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>For this cause righteousness and peace are far removed, while each deserts the fear of God and the eye of faith in him has grown dim, and men walk neither in the ordinances of his commandments nor <pb xml:id="p.15"/> use their citizenship worthily of Christ, but each goes according to the lusts of his wicked heart, and has revived the unrighteousness and impious envy, by which also “death came into the world.”</p></div></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="4">
 <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p rend="indent">For it is written thus:—"And it came to pass<note resp="editor" type="marginal">Examples of jealousy. Cain and Abel</note> after certain days that Cain offered to God a sacrifice of the fruits of the earth, and Abel himself also offered of the first-born of the sheep and of their fat.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>And God looked on Abel and his gifts, but he had no respect to Cain and his sacrifices.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>And Cain was greatly grieved and his countenance fell.</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>And God said to Cain, Why art thou grieved, and why is thy countenance fallen? If thou offeredst rightly, but didst not divide rightly, didst thou not sin?<note resp="editor" type="footnote">This is unintelligible, and does not agree with the Hebrew, which is also unintelligible. It is dealt with at length in all commentaries on Genesis.</note></p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>Be still: he shall turn to thee, and thou shalt rule over him.</p></div> 
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>And Cain said to Abel his brother, Let us go unto the plain. And it came to pass that, while they were in the plain, Cain rose up against Abel his brother and slew him.”</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p>You see, brethren,—jealousy and envy wrought fratricide.</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p>Through jealousy our father Jacob ran from the<note resp="editor" type="marginal">Jacob and Esau</note> face of Esau his brother.</p></div> 
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p>Jealousy made Joseph<note resp="editor" type="marginal">Joseph</note> to be persecuted to the death, and come into slavery.</p></div> 
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><p>Jealousy forced Moses to fly from the face of<note resp="editor" type="marginal">Moses</note> Pharaoh, King of Egypt, when his fellow countryman <pb xml:id="p.17"/> said to him, “Who made thee a judge or a ruler over us? Wouldest thou slay me as thou didst slay the Egyptian yesterday?”</p></div> 
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11"><p>Through<note resp="editor" type="marginal">Aaron and Miriam</note> jealousy Aaron and Miriam were lodged outside the camp.</p></div> 
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12"><p>Jealousy brought down Dathan and<note resp="editor" type="marginal">Dathan and Abiram</note> Abiram alive into Hades, because they rebelled against Moses the servant of God.</p></div> 
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13"><p>Through jealousy David incurred envy not only from<note resp="editor" type="marginal">David</note> strangers, but suffered persecution even from Saul, King of Israel.</p></div></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="5">
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p rend="indent">But, to cease from the examples of old time, let<note resp="editor" type="marginal">Peter and Paul</note> us come to those who contended in the days nearest to us; let us take the noble examples of our own generation.</p></div> 
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>Through jealousy and envy the greatest and most righteous pillars of the Church were persecuted and contended unto death.</p></div> 
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>Let us set before our eyes the good apostles: </p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>Peter, who because of unrighteous jealousy suffered not one or two but many trials, and having thus given his testimony went to the glorious place which was his due.</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>Through jealousy and strife Paul showred the way to the prize of endurance;	</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>seven	times	he was in bonds, he was exiled, he was stoned, he was a herald both in the East and in the West, he gained the noble fame of his faith, </p></div>
	<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p>he taught righteousness to all the world, and when he had reached the limits of the West he gave his testimony before the rulers, and thus passed from the world and was taken up into the Holy Place,—the greatest example of endurance.</p></div></div>

    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="6">
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p rend="indent">To these men with their holy lives was gathered<note resp="editor" type="marginal">The Christian martyrs</note> a great multitude of the chosen, who were the: victims of jealousy and offered among us the fairest example in their endurance under many indignities and tortures.</p></div> 
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>Through jealousy women were persecuted as Danaids and Dircae,<note resp="editor" type="footnote">No satisfactory interpretation has ever been given of this phrase: either it refers to theatrical representations by condemned Christians, or the text is hopelessly corrupt.</note> suffering terrible and unholy indignities; they stedfastly finished the course of faith, and received a noble reward, weak in the body though they were.</p></div>
        <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>Jealousy has estranged wives from husbands, and made of no effect the saying of our father Adam, “This is now bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh.”</p></div>
        <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>Jealousy and strife have overthrown great cities, and rooted up mighty nations.</p></div></div>

    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p rend="indent">We are not only writing these things to you,<note resp="editor" type="marginal">Instances of repentance</note> beloved, for your admonition, but also to remind ourselves; for we are in the same arena, and the same struggle is before us.</p></div> 
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>Wherefore let us put aside empty and vain cares, and let us come to the glorious and venerable rule of our tradition, </p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>and let us see what is good and pleasing and acceptable in the sight of our Maker.</p></div> 
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>Let us fix our gaze on the Blood of Christ, and let us <pb xml:id="p.21"/> know that it is precious to his Father,<note resp="editor" type="footnote">The Greek MSS. insert “his God,” but in different places, and the evidence of the versions confirms Lightfoot’s view that the words are interpolated.</note> because it was poured out for our salvation, and brought the grace of repentance to all the world. </p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>Let us review all the generations, and let us learn that in generation after generation the Master has given a place of repentance to those who will turn to him.</p></div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>Noah preached repentance and those who obeyed<note resp="editor" type="marginal">Noah</note> were saved.</p></div> 
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p>Jonah foretold destruction to the<note resp="editor" type="marginal">Jonah and the Ninevites</note> men of Nineveh, but when they repented they received forgiveness of their sins from God in answer to their prayer, and gained salvation, though they were aliens to God.</p></div></div>

    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="8">
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p rend="indent">The ministers of the grace of God spoke<note resp="editor" type="marginal">Repentance in the Prophets</note> through the Holy Spirit concerning repentance, </p></div>
        <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>and even the Master of the universe himself spoke with an oath concerning repentance; “For as I live, said the Lord, I do not desire the death of the sinner so much as his repentance,” and he added a gracious declaration, </p></div>
        <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>“Repent, O house of Israel, from your iniquity. Say to the sons of my people. If your sins reach from the earth to Heaven, and if they be redder than scarlet, and blacker than sackcloth, and ye turn to me with all your hearts and say ‘Father,’ I will listen to you as a holy people.”<note resp="editor" type="footnote">The origin of this quotation is obscure: possibly Clement’s text of Ezekiel was different from ours and really contained it.</note></p></div> 
        <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>And in another place he speaks thus, “Wash <pb xml:id="p.23"/> you, and make you clean, put away your wickedness from your souls before my eyes, cease from your wickedness, learn to do good, seek out judgment, rescue the wronged, give judgment for the orphan, do justice to the widow, and come and let us reason together, saith the Lord; and if your sins be as crimson, I will make them white as snow, and if they be as scarlet, I will make them white as wool, and if ye be willing and hearken to me, ye shall eat the good things of the land, but if ye be not willing, and hearken not to me, a sword shall devour you, for the mouth of the Lord has spoken these things.”</p></div> 
        <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>Thus desiring to give to all his beloved a share in repentance, he established it by his Almighty will.</p></div></div>

    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>Let us fix our gaze on those who have rendered perfect service to his excellent glory.</p></div> 
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>Let us take Enoch, who was<note resp="editor" type="marginal">Enoch</note> found righteous in obedience, and was translated, and death did not befall him.</p></div> 
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>Noah was found<note resp="editor" type="marginal">Noah</note> faithful in his service, in foretelling a new beginning to the world, and through him the Master saved the living creatures which entered in concord into the Ark.</p></div></div>

 <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="10">
     <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>Abraham, who was called “the Friend”, was<note resp="editor" type="marginal">Abraham</note> found faithful in his obedience to the words of God.</p></div>
 <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>He in obedience went forth from his country and from his kindred and from his father’s house, that by leaving behind a little country and a feeble kindred and a small house he might inherit the promises of God. For God says to him, </p></div>
 <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>“Depart from thy land and from thy kindred and from thy father’s house to' the land which I shall show thee, and I will make thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and I will magnify thy name, and thou shalt be blessed; and I will bless those that bless thee, and I will curse those that curse thee, and all the tribes of the earth shall be blessed in thee.”</p></div> 
     <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>And again, when he was separated from Lot, God said to him, “Lift up thine eyes and look from the place where thou art now, to the North and to the South and to the East and to the West; for all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it and to thy seed for ever.</p></div> 
     <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth. If a man can number the dust of the earth thy seed shall also be numbered.”</p></div> 
     <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>And again he says, “God led forth Abraham, and said to him, ‘Look up to the Heaven and number the stars, if thou canst number them; so shall thy seed be.’ And Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness.”</p></div> 
     <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p>Because of his faith and hospitality a son was given him in <pb xml:id="p.27"/> his old age, and in his obedience he offered him as a sacrifice to God on the mountain<note resp="editor" type="footnote">Or possibly, with the other reading, “on one of the mountains.”</note> which he showed him.</p></div></div>

    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="11">
        <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>For his hospitality and piety Lot was saved out<note resp="editor" type="marginal">Lot</note> of Sodom when the whole countryside was judged by fire and brimstone, and the Master made clear that he does not forsake those who hope in him, but delivers to punishment and torture those who turn aside to others.</p></div> 
        <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>For of this a sign was given<note resp="editor" type="marginal">Lot’s wife</note> when his wife went with him, but changed her mind and did not remain in agreement with him, so that she became a pillar of salt unto this day, to make known to all, that those who are double-minded, and have doubts concerning the power of God, incur judgment and become a warning to all generations.</p></div></div>

    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="12">
        <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>For her faith and hospitality Rahab the harlot<note resp="editor" type="footnote">Or possibly “who was called a harlot,”</note><note resp="editor" type="marginal">Rahab</note> was saved.</p></div> 
        <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>For when the spies were sent to Jericho by Joshua the son of Nun, the King of the land knew that they had come to spy out his country, and sent men to take them, that they might be captured and put to death.</p></div> 
        <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>So the hospitable Rahab took them in, and hid them in the upper room under the stalks of flax.</p></div> 
        <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>And when the <pb xml:id="p.29"/> king’s men came and said, “The spies of our land came in to thee, bring them out, for the king orders thus,” she answered “The men whom ye seek did indeed come to me, but they went away forthwith, and are proceeding on their journey,” and pointed in the wrong direction.</p></div> 
        <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>And she said to the men, “I know assuredly that the Lord God is delivering to you this land; for the fear and dread of you has fallen on those who dwell in it.

        <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>And they said to her, “It shall be as thou hast spoken to us; when therefore thou knowest that we are at hand, thou shalt gather all thy folk under thy roof, and they shall be safe; for as many as shall be found outside the house shall perish.”</p></div> 
        <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p>And they proceeded to give her a sign, that she should hang out a scarlet thread from her house, foreshowing that all who believe and hope on God shall have redemption through the blood of the Lord.</p></div> 
        <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p>You see, beloved, that the woman is an instance not only of faith but also of prophecy.</p></div></div>

        <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>For lie spoke thus: “Be merciful, that ye may obtain mercy. Forgive, that ye may be forgiven. As ye do, so shall it be done unto you.
